## Intro

This repo is a fork of [transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit).

It uses Notion as a CMS, [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Setup

**All config is defined in [site.config.ts](./site.config.ts).**

This project requires a recent version of Node.js (recommend >= 16).

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` to test locally
3. `npm run deploy` to deploy to vercel ðŸ’ª

### Vercel Configuration

**Social media preview images won't work by default on Vercel**. You'll need to ensure that your site doesn't require auth.

From your Vercel project settings, you'll want to **disable Vercel Authentication** from `Project -> Settings -> Deployment Protection`.

![How to disable Vercel Deployment Protection setting](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1eb5a1f-da7a-497e-b4f6-f7e851a6cd8a 'How to disable Vercel Deployment Protection setting which causes social media preview image endpoint to return 401 Unauthorized')

### Redis

Redis is used to cache generated preview images to speed up subsequent builds. [Redis Labs](https://redis.com) is used as the exertnal [Redis](https://redis.io) data store. To enable redis caching, `isRedisEnabled` is set to `true` in `site.config.ts` and then `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variables to point to the redis instance.

Locally this is done by adding a `.env` file:

```bash
REDIS_HOST='TODO'
REDIS_PASSWORD='TODO'
```

## Styles

All CSS styles that customize Notion content are located in [styles/notion.css](./styles/notion.css). They mainly target global CSS classes exported by react-notion-x [styles.css](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x/blob/master/packages/react-notion-x/src/styles.css).

Every notion block gets its own unique classname, so you can target individual blocks like this:

```css
.notion-block-260baa77f1e1428b97fb14ac99c7c385 {
  display: none;
}
```

## Dark Mode

Dark mode is fully supported and can be toggled via the sun / moon icon in the footer/header.

## Responsive

All pages are designed to be responsive across common device sizes.

## Environment Variables

Redis environment variables, have been [added to the Vercel project](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables). These environment variables have been added as GitHub [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).
